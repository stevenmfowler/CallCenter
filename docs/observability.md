# Observability Framework

## Overview
The Call Center Platform implements comprehensive observability practices to ensure system reliability, performance monitoring, and rapid issue resolution.

## Monitoring Components

### Application Insights
- **Request Tracking**: All Azure Functions invocations tracked with request IDs
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, throughput, error rates
- **Custom Telemetry**: Business metrics like calls processed per minute
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing across function calls

### Azure Monitor
- **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, storage utilization
- **Azure Service Metrics**: Event Hub throughput, storage operations
- **Custom Alerts**: Threshold-based alerts for critical conditions
- **Log Analytics**: Centralized log aggregation and querying

### Function App Diagnostics
- **Live Metrics**: Real-time performance dashboard
- **Application Logs**: Detailed function execution logs
- **System Logs**: Platform-level diagnostics
- **Scale Events**: Automatic scaling decisions and outcomes

## Key Metrics & KPIs

### Performance Metrics
- **Latency**: End-to-end processing time (target < 5 seconds)
- **Throughput**: Messages per second (scale to handle peak loads)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed operations (< 0.1%)
- **Availability**: Uptime SLA tracking (target 99.9%)

### Business Metrics
- **Data Volume**: GB of call data processed daily
- **Source Coverage**: Percentage of configured sources actively ingesting
- **Data Quality**: Valid records vs total records processed
- **Processing Lag**: Time from ingestion to storage completion

## Alerting Strategy

### Critical Alerts
- Function app errors > 5%
- Event Hub backlog > 1000 messages
- Storage account throttling
- Key Vault access failures

### Warning Alerts
- Increased latency > 2x baseline
- Memory usage > 80%
- Disk space > 85%
- Authentication failures

### Informational Alerts
- Deployment completions
- Configuration changes
- Security events
- Compliance violations

## Logging Strategy

### Log Levels
- **Error**: Unhandled exceptions and critical failures
- **Warning**: Degraded performance or potential issues
- **Information**: Normal operational events
- **Debug**: Detailed troubleshooting information (production-disabled)

### Structured Logging
- Consistent log format across all components
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Business context in log entries

### Log Retention
- Application logs: 30 days hot, 90 days cold storage
- Audit logs: 7 years compliance requirement
- Metrics: 90 days rolling retention

## Dashboards & Visualization

### Operational Dashboard
- Real-time metrics overview
- Alert status and recent incidents
- System health indicators
- Key performance trends

### Business Intelligence Dashboard
- Call volume trends by source
- Processing efficiency metrics
- Quality assurance indicators
- Compliance reporting views

### Incident Response Dashboard
- Alert timeline and impact assessment
- Diagnostic information for troubleshooting
- Recovery progress tracking
- Post-mortem analysis tools

## Troubleshooting Guides

### Common Scenarios
- **High Latency**: Check Event Hub consumer lag, function scaling
- **Message Backlog**: Monitor consumer group lag, increase partitions
- **Storage Throttling**: Check request rates, implement circuit breaker
- **Authentication Failures**: Validate Key Vault connectivity, RBAC permissions

### Diagnostic Tools
- Application Insights transaction search
- Live metrics streaming
- KQL queries for log analysis
- Azure Monitor insights

## Incident Response

### Escalation Matrix
- **Level 1**: Automatic alerts, initial triage (development team)
- **Level 2**: Escalation to senior engineers (< 15 min response)
- **Level 3**: Executive notification for business impact (> 30 min downtime)

### Runbooks
- Automated recovery procedures
- Manual failover processes
- Communication templates for stakeholders
- Customer impact assessment guidelines

## Continuous Improvement

### Retrospective Process
- Regular review of incidents and near-misses
- Identification of monitoring gaps
- Alert tuning based on false positives
- Tool and process improvements

### Proactive Monitoring
- Predictive analytics for capacity planning
- Anomaly detection algorithms
- Synthetic transaction monitoring
- Dependency health checks
